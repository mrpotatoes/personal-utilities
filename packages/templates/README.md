# Templating engines
## Why 
I'll be using a templating engine + flat files to help build these out for these reasons:
1. Flat files with replacement tokens makes it super easy to write templates.
1. Simpler and easier to get setup than JSX/React.
1. I'm outputting text files not an XML dialect.
1. I can read the files into a module.

## Requirements
In no particular order
1. Easy template engine that requires a single module
1. Can export the template out as a function so I can call else where.
