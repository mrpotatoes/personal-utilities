The intention here is to make a ts-monorepo starter pack (generator/builder) based on `NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo`. 

The reason for this is multiple.

1. I don't want to build and configure this myself. That's tedious and error prone.
1. I just want to get into using a monorepo + typescript asap.
1. This works so well, there isn't anything I need/want to add.

So using their examples I will build my generator on top of it (with my changes added such as namespaces).

So my plan is to take this wholesale (`NiGhTTraX` allows a template to be made of their repo) and will start adding my packages. Then I will put some effort into learning how to write code and build via this monorepo. Lastly I will start building out my generator that effectivly will make THIS repo but repeatable via a CLI (`npx`).
